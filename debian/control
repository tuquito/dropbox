Description: Easily share and sync files across computers and mobile devices with free space online.
 Put your files into your Dropbox on one computer, and they'll be instantly available on any of your other computers that also have Dropbox installed (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone/iPad...etc). Because copies of your files are stored on Dropbox's secure servers, you can also access them from any computer or mobile device using the Dropbox website.
